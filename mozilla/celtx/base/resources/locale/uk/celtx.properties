# The rules for Singular/Paucal/Plural differ for each language.
# The general distinction is "one"/"some"/"many", so choose the one
# that corresponds closest to your language, and it will probably be
# correct. For example, Latvian has a special case for 0. Most languages
# only have singular and plural, so repeat the plural if that's the case.
